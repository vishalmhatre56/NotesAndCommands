step1:  Create and push project on gitHub.(project must have package.json)

step2: 	goto www.heroku.com and sign up or log in.

step3:	install heroku (old: toolbelt.heroku.com ==> redirect to diff website[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli]).
	click on : Download and install

	>heroku keys:add
	it will detect if there is any key available or you will be promted to create new key : enter y
	this will create new key and add it into heroku keys.

	you can check >heroku keys.

	this will connect to heroku server with ssh key and ask you "are you sure want to connect : " enter yes	
	
	you will get "authentication succeeded (publickey)" then it will be successfully connected otherwise you will get access denied.

step7:	port number must be dynamic and you can get the port set by heroku server in enviernmen variable.
	"process.env.PORT"

step8:  you need to add script for start command in package.json (eg: start:"node server.js")

step9:  commit updated code and push it to gitHub.

step10:  run ">heroku create <app name>" from projects root folder.

step11:  >git push heroku

step12:  your app will be deployed on heroku if it does not have errors and.

step13:  you can manage your app by visiting herokus.com website.

step14:  you can update your code, add functionality to app and push those changes to gitHub and then run ">git push heroku".

	 you can visit app by using url that given in logs of step11 command. 

step15:  to connect to the mongodb : you need to create account on "https://mlab.com/signup/"

	url: Copy the SRV address:
		mongodb+srv://vishalmhatre56:<PASSWORD>@cluster0-cpvan.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true
	
      ðŸ‘‰My actual connection:
	mongoose.connect(`mongodb+srv://cluster0-cpvan.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true`, {
    		auth: {
        		user: 'vishalmhatre56',
		        password: 'vishal#56',

     		console.log("-----\nUnable to connect to the mongodb server,\nError:", err) 
    	});
